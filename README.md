# FPGA-Fabric_Design_and_Architecture
This document is a report of the 5-day intensive workshop on FPGAs, organized by [VLSI System Design](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/).<br/>
As a gist, a 4-bit counter and RVMyth processor are taken as the units under test. These are processed on various platforms (Basys3, VTR, and SOFA), and the results obtained on these platforms are compared from timing, power, and area point of view. Day-to-day gist of the workshop is given below:<br/>
- On day-1, a 4-bit counter is designed on Basys3 and the Virtual Input/Output (VIO) strobes of the results are demonstrated.<br/>
- On day-2, Verilog To Route (VTR) flow is explored with the 4-bit counter example and the results (timing, Power, and Area) of VTR and Basys3 are compared.<br/>
- On day-3, the processor code for RVMyth is studied and is run till bitstream on Basys3.<br/>
- On day-4, the timing, Power, and Area results of the 4-bit counter are studied on Skywater OpenSource FPGA (SOFA).<br/>
- On day-5, the RVMyth processor is studied on SOFA and the timing, power, and area results are noted.<br/>

The elaboration of these steps makes this document.<br/>

### Introduction to FPGA

After the complete design flow, ASICs are sent to the foundry for fabrication. Once fabrication is done, no change can be made on the IC, especially at the design level. This fact imposes a huge pressure on the reliabilty of the design. It'd be very useful (not just from monetary terms, but from time to market point of view as well)  to have a programmable device that could be used to test multiple design codes (reprogrammable). Research towards this goal yielded devices such as Programmable Logic Arrays (PLAs), Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). They basically synthesize a customizable hardware and this hardware could then be used to study the timing, power, and area parameters of the design. **This course uses Basys3 FPGA offered by Xilinx**.

Just like we get the layout as the end product of the whole design procedure of an ASIC, we get a *BITSTREAM* in case of an FPGA. The architecture of an FPGA is explained using the below figure:

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14873110/171280765-bd85f861-c70e-40fd-9e38-99fe0f7bae5a.png)

Since there is a Flip-Flop bank in the CLB, it is capable of storing small data.
  
The below figure shows one of the many ways a code ``` Z = ~(X.Y) ``` could get realised on an FPGA, by using LUT from one of the CLBs:
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14873110/171394247-f12bd76b-336b-4bb1-998f-1fd864b4b1ea.png)
  
The following figure shows a zoom-out view of how the above NAND gate is actually realized. It may be noted that each I/O port can have multiple wires (X, Y, and Z signals are given to wires and connections between these wires (also called interconnets) are made or broken depending on the requirement). 
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14873110/171398044-f2dc6a69-b768-42e5-ad9c-94d0eb25cc7d.png)

Also, interconnections can be made between different CLBs. Let's say, for example, we'd like to implement an expression ``` Z = ~(X.Y) + P ```. A single CLB may be used to realise this logic but alternately, two CLBs might be used too. This is shown in the below figure:
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14873110/171403330-286ecfc5-85dc-49c3-b9d1-843ea3cc50e0.png)

CLB_1 implements the NAND logic, while CLB_2 implements the OR logic. Closely observing the connections made it may be obvious that the block diagram implemented is:
  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR;
    X --> id1([CLB_1]);
    Y --> id1([CLB_1]);
    id1([CLB_1]) --> id2([CLB_2]);
    P --> id2([CLB_2]);
    id2([CLB_2]) --> Z;
  ```
  
The design flow of FPGA is briefed in the following flow-chart:
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TD;
    Architecture_Description --> RTL_Design_and_TestBench;
    RTL_Design_and_TestBench --> Behavioural_Simulation;
    Behavioural_Simulation --> Synthesis_and_Timing_Analysis;
    Timing_Constraints -->  Synthesis_and_Timing_Analysis;
    Pin_Assignments -->  Synthesis_and_Timing_Analysis;
    Synthesis_and_Timing_Analysis --> Implementating_Place_and_Route;
    Implementating_Place_and_Route --> Bitstream_Generation
  ```

The generated bitstream would be used (either on software or hardware) to get Timing, Power, and Area reports.
  
The following pointers are to considered while writing RTL for FPGAs:
  - Delays should be implemented by designing counters and then keep counting for a few cycles (depending on how much delay is required). #time is not synthesizeable.
  - There is no provison to _initialize_ a variable. The ``` initial ``` block is only for testbenches.
  - User Defined Primitives (UDPs) are non-synthesizeable (obviously!).
  - Indeterminate sizes should be given a fixed size to get synthesized.
  - If the design has loops, it should be made sure that these loops are terminating.


**Some information about Basys3** :  
The following figure (taken from [here](https://digilent.com/reference/basys3/refmanual)) highlights the importamt components on the Basys3 board: 
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14873110/171421117-f502731a-2797-4972-b489-98cfaebad0cf.png)

 Ironically, the most important component is not highlighted, the FPGA bank. According the [reference manual](https://digilent.com/reference/basys3/refmanual),</br>
 
  " _The Basys3 board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform based on the latest Artix-7â„¢ Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx. With its high-capacity FPGA [XC7A35T-1CPG236C](https://docs.xilinx.com/v/u/en-US/ds181_Artix_7_Data_Sheet), low overall cost, and collection of USB, VGA, and other ports, the Basys3 can host designs ranging from introductory combinational circuits to complex sequential circuits like embedded processors and controllers. It includes enough switches, LEDs and other I/O devices to allow a large number designs to be completed without the need for any additional hardware, and enough uncommitted FPGA I/O pins to allow designs to be expanded using Digilent Pmods or other custom boards and circuits_ ".</br>
  
There are different ways of programming the board:
```mermaid
flowchart TD;
  Programming --> On_site_using_the_actual_board;
  Programming --> Remote;
  Remote --> Send_input_through_VIO_observe_output_on_actual_board;
  Remote --> Input_through_VIO_output_observed_on_ILA;
```
In remote way of programming, if the IP address of the board is known, we may send the input to the board through Virtual Input/Output (VIO), and observe the output from the board. In cases where the board is not available (like this workshop), the inputs are processed through VIO and the output can be observed on a Integrated Logic Analyser (ILA).

### Vivado Counter

Vivado is an Integrated Design Environment (IDE) from Xilinx (now AMD). The tool offers an intuitive GUI and all of its options are written in native Tool Command Language (TCL). Vivado can be used for analysis and constraint assignment at any stage of the design (such as synthesis, PnR). 

Once opened (by using ```vivado ``` command), we may either create a new project or open an existing project. Upon choosing to create a new project, the tool prompts us to choose the board we wish to work upon. If we can't find the tool in the drop-down list, we need to update it's board library (there's a button for that), and then choose the board. The following code is then loaded as a design source:

```Verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Description: 4 bit counter with source clock (100MHz) division.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
module counter_clk_div(clk,rst,counter_out);
input clk,rst;
reg div_clk;
reg [25:0] delay_count;
output reg [3:0] counter_out;

//////////clock division block////////////////////
always @(posedge clk)
begin

  if(rst)
    begin
      delay_count<=26'd0;
      div_clk <= 1'b0; //initialise div_clk
      counter_out<=4'b0000;
    end

  else
    if(delay_count==26'd212)
      begin
        delay_count<=26'd0; //reset upon reaching the max value
        div_clk <= ~div_clk;  //generating a slow clock
      end

    else
      begin
        delay_count<=delay_count+1;
      end
end
/////////////4 bit counter block///////////////////
always @(posedge div_clk)
begin

  if(rst)
    begin
      counter_out<=4'b0000;
    end
  else
    begin
      counter_out<= counter_out+1;
    end
end

endmodule 
```
As commented in the code, it is a 4-bit counter. The following snapshot from the [reference manual](https://digilent.com/reference/basys3/refmanual) of Basys3 says that the internal clock speed is 100MHz. In order to observe and analyse the output comfortably, the clock speed has been scaled down around 470kHz by using a delay loop. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14873110/171512051-c72bc658-7848-4b33-89ec-13121970b2dc.png)

The following testbench is then loaded as a simulation source:

```Verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module test_counter();
reg clk, reset;
wire [3:0] out;

//create an instance of the design
counter_clk_div dut(clk, reset, out);  

initial begin
//these statements are sequential and are executed one after the other 
clk=0;  //at time=0
reset=1;//at time=0
#20; //delay 20 units
reset=0; //after 20 units of time, reset becomes 0
end
always 
#5 clk=~clk;  // toggle or negate the clk input every 5 units of time

endmodule
```

The following result is observed upon simulation:

It may be observed that the count is increasing for each clk_div posedge.</br>

Check this snapshot from Vivado GUI which shows the steps that are done one after the other:

Since simulation is done, the next step is RTL analysis. This is done by opening an elaborated design. Check below snapshot from Xilinx [user guide](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug892-vivado-design-flows-overview/RTL-Elaboration-and-Analysis)

The report of the elaborated design looks as below. We'd have choice to analyse layout, I/O planning, and floorplanning. The below figure shows I/O planning,and different pins avaiable:
